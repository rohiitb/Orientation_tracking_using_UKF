# Orientation_tracking_using_UKF

This project was done as a part of the course ESE650 : Learning in Robotics at UPenn. This project involves implementing Quaternion based orientation tracking using an Unscented Kalman filter. The algorithm was adopted from the paper : [Unscented-Kalman filter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1257247). Quaternion representation of the orientation is much more efficient in terms of computation. The non-linear relationship between estimated orientation and the measurements prevent the usage of the classical kalman filter. This is where Unscented Kalman filter comes in effect which allows nonlinear process and measurement models and is more accurate than Extended Kalman Filters.
